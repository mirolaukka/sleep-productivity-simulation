# sleep-productivity-simulation


### Starting Idea:

Explore the correlation between sleep duration and productivity through simulation.

The concept involves simulating the sleep patterns of individuals and their corresponding productivity levels. The objective is to identify the optimal sleep duration that maximizes productivity.

This simulation is contingent upon several key parameters:

* α (Alpha): The rate of energy restoration during sleep.
* β (Beta): The number of hours slept.
* γ (Gamma): The rate of energy depletion per hour of productivity.
* δ (Delta): The rate at which productivity decreases due to diminishing energy levels.

Within this simulation, a day comprises 24 hours, during which individuals alternate between two states: WORKING and SLEEPING. When working, productivity accumulates for the day, while an individual's energy level decreases at a rate determined by γ. During sleep, energy levels are replenished based on α.

The primary objective of this simulation is to analyze the intricate relationship between sleep patterns and productivity.

An underlying assumption is that the results will follow a bell curve pattern. The metric under scrutiny is the total productivity achieved during the 24-hour timeframe.
